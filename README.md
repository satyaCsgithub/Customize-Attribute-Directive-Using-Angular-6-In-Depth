# Customize-Attribute-Directive-Using-Angular-6-In-Depth
We can create custom attribute directives and custom structural directives using @Directive decorator. Using custom attribute directive we can change appearance such as text color, background color and font size of body of an HTML element that can be called host element. To change appearance angular provides ElementRef class that can directly access DOM. It is vulnerable to XSS attacks when we directly use ElementRef in our application. It is better to create a custom directive and use ElementRef inside directive to change appearance or behavior of the host element.
